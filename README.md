Roger Ehmpke
===================

The new Roger Ehmpke site 2016. I am still working through this site.

## Dev Environment
The site takes advantage of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/). Still trying to get the right mix for current development.

Temporarily I am running my site with the following in the terminal.

This also requires [Bower](https://bower.io/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) but that is kind of obvious.
At the moment I am using, `$ bundle exec jekyll serve --watch` to watch and serve my Jekyll.

[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) is used for watching and updating my [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SCSS_FOR_SASS_USERS.html) into css file. by saying `grunt`

Then it can be loaded at **localhost:4000**
